pycc (Python Compiler Collections)

The Python ecosystem offers a vast array of publicly available libraries and 
frameworks. While this flexibility is highly beneficial for most developers, it 
presents significant challenges for systems that must undergo rigorous auditing 
and long-term maintenance. Python's relatively short support window for 
releases further complicates this issue. As dependencies become outdated and 
Python versions reach end-of-life, organizations are forced to either 
continuously update their systems or maintain legacy environments with 
increasing security and operational risks.

One approach to mitigating these challenges is to compile Python code into 
static executables.

The pycc library is designed to introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation, 
inline assembly, and other low-level capabilities to Python, enabling the 
creation of fully static binaries. To support long-term stability and 
auditability, pycc intentionally restricts the supported subset of Python 
syntax. This constraint allows for deterministic analysis, reduces complexity, 
and removes the runtime dependency on the Python interpreter.

Although pycc itself will evolve over time, applications built on top of it are 
intended to remain stable, minimizing the need for ongoing code changes by end 
users.
